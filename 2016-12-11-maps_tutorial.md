## Why use R for spatial data?

- Less clicking Most conventional GIS software use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which makes them easier to fumble through when you don't know what you're doing, but point and click interfaces become very laborious when performing analyses for the _n_ th time or when you really know your way around the software. R runs using a Command Line Interface, so while there may be more of a learning curve to begin with, it's pretty sweet once you know what to do.

- Reproducible analyses with new data

- Free

- A range of GIS packages for different applications
