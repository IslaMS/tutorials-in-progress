# Future Tutorial Ideas

## Cleaning up datasets in more detail
* Subsetting using []
* Renaming rows and columns
* Deadling with spaces in rows (e.g. when you think it's a NA, but it's not blank, cause there is a space)
* Getting rid of NAs

## Dealing with Large Datasets
* Import methods
  * data.table
  * fread
  * read_
* Data Manipulation
  * Being parsimonious
  * Taking advantage of R object orientated environment
  * Pipes revist
* .RData objects
* Saving a workspace

## Time Series Data
* lubridate
* zoo
* xts
* quantmod
* plotting using ggplot2

## Structural Equation Modelling

## Intro to Python (Need someone else to run this, Geology/geography/geomorphology folk use it a lot, talk to Simon Mudd)

## Coding etiquette and reproducible research (Gergana has dibs)
* Formatting graphs and tables for professional publication
* packrat - for package management in a project
* Lots of links to other tutorials
 * github tut.
 * RMarkdown tut.

## Making an R package with useful functions
* theme_clean

## General RStudio IDE Customisation
* Addins
* Syntax highlighting
* Autocomplete

## Scenario challenge
* Test student's abilities by drawing on ideas from multiple tutorials
* In the context of taking an experiment through data exploration, analysis, presentation, publishing
* Example:
  * Clean and get ready for analysis (Tut.2)
  * Create explanatory figures of relationships between variables (Tut.4)
  * Test a hypothesis using general linear models (Tut.5)
  * Test another hypothesis using a heirarchical model (Tut.7)
  * Create an Rmarkdown script of their work (Tut.6)
  * Upload the whole lot to a github repo (Tut.3)
  
# Website developments
* Expandable dropdown boxes for parts of tutorials, to streamline tutorial page
* Common problems page (could this be an interactive flowchart?)
